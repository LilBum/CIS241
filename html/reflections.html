        <p>CIS 241 was my first time working with HTML and CSS, I have done coding before but web development was very new to me.<br> 
            Luckily, it was not difficult to get the hang of and I quickly started to enjoy making my website look as great as possible.<br>  
            I like being able to include a bit of myself in this website and any future websites I might make.<br><br>   
        </p>
        <p>I would still say that I prefer programming over web development but that isn't to say that I haven't enjoyed this class and that what I learned won't be useful for me in the future.<br>  
            Regarding the class itself, I would say that the amount of work given did not correlate to increased learning, at least for me.<br>  
            The tedious tasks of having to write hundreds of words for topics that would be fine with >100 words did make this class a bit of a headache for me. 
            I feel that the labs and quizzes were very nicely set up and they did help learn quickly and efficiently.<br><br> 
        </p>
        <p>Overall, nothing is perfect and this class is no exception, I did learn a lot and had an overall good experience<br>  
            but I do feel like some things could be changed and that it would make the class many times better.
