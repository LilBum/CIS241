            I read many different varieties of books, mainly webnovels. 
            Webnovels are similar to normal novels but they are written online and are usually very long (thousands of chapters).
            They tend to focus on more fantasy oriented themes and are admittedly lower quality than the average novel. 
            Besides webnovels I also enjoy manga and webtoons which are both books that have detailed art in order to explain the story better.  
            The difference between the two is what country they are from (manga from Japan and webtoon from Korea).

        <h2>Horror</h2>

            I've been watching horror movies 
            for as long as I can remember and recently I've started to read a lot of horror (especially Stephen King).
            My favorite horror movies are The Strangers, The Conjuring, and The Thing.
            My favorite horror novel would have to be Salem's Lot because it is the only book that has actually been "scary".

            Right around the start of the pandemic is when I first started to seriously workout 
            I started out using weights but I quickly became disinterested and decided to stick to only bodyweight.
            This was a lot more challenging and engaging for me. I hope to continue working out like this for as long as I can, 
            I also feel that if you want to start working out, calisthenics is a great way to dive in because of the low barrier to entry 
            and the fact that you can workout just about anywhere.

                My main hobby for this past year has been learning Japanese.
                In the beginning I had a hard time just grasping the basic alphabet because of how different it is from English
                but over time I have gotten pretty good at reading and am dedicating most of my time to being able to understand native material.
                As for speaking, I don't have many opportunities right now to practice so I just do what I can and hope that I'll come across some fortuitous opportunities.
