            My name is Alexander Urs-Badet. I was born in Lynnwood but my family is originally from Romania. <br>I have one younger brother and a dog named Baby who is a maltese.<br> 
            I’m currently a student and am working towards a Full Stack Developer certification.<br> 
            I only started coding in the spring of 2022 and have done some internships that have allowed me to get a lot more experience than I could just by being in a classroom.<br><br>

            </div>
            In my free time, I am usually on my computer, reading, or working out. I’ve been playing video games for most of my life,<br> 
            originally on a console but currently on a PC. I also like building computers seeing as it is cheaper than buying one and it is also much more rewarding doing it yourself.<br>
            My favorite book is The Count of Monte Cristo but the Percy Jackson series is very close behind that, you can’t beat nostalgia I guess.<br><br>

            </div> 
            When it comes to my goals in life, I do want to get a job as a software developer but only because if I didn't, I'm not sure what else I would do.<br> 
            I enjoy learning languages and find translating different forms of media very fun but I also know that both areas require a lot of dedication<br> 
            so I have a lot of figuring out to do before I can settle on any one path.<br>
